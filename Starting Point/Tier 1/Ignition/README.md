## Solution

### Scan with nmap

Type:

```
nmap -sC -sV {target ip} -v
```

![nmap](./Screenshots/ignitionnmap.png)

`80/tcp` is open. Service is `http`.

#### Disclaimer

As the nmap scan says `http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://ignition.htb/`, I would recommend adding `{target ip} ignition.htb` into your `/etc/hosts` file.

To do this type:

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

At the very end paste section from above and `save` it. You can do that by `Ctrl + X`. Then press `Y`.

After pasting `target ip` into the browser we can see the website.

### gobuster

Type:

```
gobuster dir -u http://ignition.htb/ -w {path to dictionary you want to use}
```

`dir` - Specifies the mode of Gobuster to use, in this case, directory brute-forcing.

`-u` - Specifies the target URL to scan.

`-w` - Specifies the wordlist to use for the directory brute-forcing.

We found `admin` login panel.

```
http://ignition.htb/admin
```

I found it on the Internet that default `Magento` admin credentials are:

```
admin:123123
```

Let's try this combination.

It haven't worked.

### Burpsuite

As only one port is open - `80/tcp`, the only reasonable option is to brute force the password.

Usually the administrator's username is not changed, so since default `Magento` credentials are not working, focusing on password seems smart.

Let's intercept the `login request`:

![Burpsuite](./Screenshots/ignitionburp.png)

Send it to `Intruder` by pressing `Ctrl + I`.

Now, select the password payload which you provided and press `Add ยง`.

![Burpsuite](./Screenshots/ignitionburp3.png)

Next, in the `Payloads` section `load` wordlist of passwords you want to try.

![Burpsuite](./Screenshots/ignitionburp4.png)

If it's done, press `Start attack`.

![Burpsuite](./Screenshots/ignitionburp5.png)

We found the `password`. It's `qwerty123`.
