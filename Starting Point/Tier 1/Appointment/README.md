## Solution

### Scan with nmap

Type:

```
nmap -sC -sV {target ip} -v
```

![nmap](appointmentnmap.png)

80/tcp is open. Service is `http`.

You can paste `target ip` into the browser and you should see this:

### Burpsuite with a SQL Injection

We will use `Burpsuite`. If you are not familiar with this tool, search for some tutorials via Internet. Also, make every effort to understand how to set up a proxy.

We are going to put fake credentials like `test` `test` to intercept the request.

Send this request to intruder.

Mark `test` after username and click `Add ยง` icon.

Go to `Payloads` section and in `Payload settings` load payload which you want to use.

If all of the above is done press `Start attack`.

We can see that three payloads have worked:

```
admin' #
```

```
admin' or '1'='1
```

```
admin' or '1'='1'#
```

#### Disclaimer

To do this I recommend dictionary from `SecLists`. Full path:

```
SecLists/Fuzzing/SQLi/quick-SQLi.txt 
```

### Get the flag

To get the flag we have to paste one of the payloads above as `Username` and whatever you want as `Password`.
